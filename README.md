# Adafruit NFC/RFID Shield documantation
Since Adafruit lacks documentation about how the PN532 NFC/RFID Controller Shield for Arduino works, I decided I would documentate the installation and code of the Shield. The Shield is compatible with most of the Arduino's, but I am using an Arduino Leonardo.

## Solder the shield
The first part of the installation is to solder the shield. If you don't know how to solder, I recommend you to find someone to do it for you, since it's quite a precise job. Make sure every pin is only connected to the corresponding hole in the shield, and doesn't touch any other pin.

# The code itself
